## :sparkles: Features ##


    00-  Java needed classes (POJO , DAO, web service and a tester client for the web service).
    01- The data set was converted into dataframe and Spark RDD and displayed in charts.
    02- Display structure and summary of the data.
    03- Clean the data (null, duplications)
    04- Count the jobs for each company and display that in order
    05- Show step 4 in a pie chart
    06- Find out What are it the most popular job titles?
    07- Show step 6 in bar chart
    08- Find out the most popular areas?
    09- Show step 8 in bar chart
    10- Print skills one by one and how many each repeated and order the output to find out the most important skills required?
    11- Factorize the YearsExp feature and convert it to numbers in new col.
    12- Apply K-means for job title and companies
